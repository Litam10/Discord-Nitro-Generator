# Discord-Nitro-Generator
The script generates random Discord Nitro gift codes, sends requests to redeem them.

EDIT:-
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"--- To your own webhook url

The provided Script serves as a basic Discord Nitro generator. It continuously generates random alphanumeric codes and attempts to redeem them on the Discord platform via API requests. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

Code Generation: It generates random alphanumeric strings of 18 characters, simulating potential Discord Nitro gift codes.

Request Handling: The generated code is then used to construct a request URL to the Discord API for redeeming Nitro gifts. The code sends a GET request to this URL.

Response Handling: Upon receiving a response from the Discord API, the code checks the status code. If the status code is 200, it indicates a successful redemption attempt, and the code logs the success and sends a message to a configured Discord webhook. If the status code is 429, it means the request has been rate-limited. The code then checks if a "retry_after" value is provided in the response. If so, it waits for the specified duration before retrying the request. If not, it retries the request immediately. For any other status code, the code logs a failure.

Rate Limit Handling: The code incorporates rate limit handling to avoid hitting the Discord API too frequently, respecting the server's rate limits and preventing being temporarily blocked due to excessive requests.

Looping and Delay: The code runs in an infinite loop, continuously generating and attempting to redeem codes. It introduces a delay of 5 seconds between each attempt to adhere to rate limits and prevent spamming the server.

Overall, this code serves as a basic framework for experimenting with Discord Nitro code generation and redemption, with built-in mechanisms for handling rate limits and logging results
